<p><em>World Sector Performance</em></p>
<!-- <p><br></p> -->

<h4><b>Treasury Bond Market Collapse</b></h4>
<p>Since March 2020, treasury bonds with maturities of 10 years or more have plummeted 46%.These losses are almost in line with stock market losses seen during the dot com bubble burst and the aftermath of 2008. 10 Year yields have now soared to 4.887% this week. Brad Setser, a former Treasury official wrote recently stating that China are not dumping US bonds, having held a stable portfolio since 2015. The graph below shows their estimated portfolio of US Debt.</p>

<h4><b>OpenAI's Busy Week</b></h4>
<p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI claimed that he owns zero percent of the company, although investor David Sacks speculated Altman actually controls OpenAI through its nonprofit parent company where he likely has significant control.</p>
<p>OpenAI are supposedly gearing up for a $90bn valuation, which is triple their previous valuation set in April, which is a similar gain to NVIDIA's growth for the whole year! There are rumours of OpenAI launching AI-based smartphones although this is purely speculation right now.</p>

<h4><b>Nonfarm Payrolls</b></h4>
<p>Nonfarm payrolls increased by 336,000 in September, well exceeding expectations of 170,000. This is the stronest job gain in 8 months and should give the FED confidence in keeping interest rates higher for longer.</p>

<h4><b>The Fall of NFT's (for now)</b></h4>
<p>NFTs are entries on a blockchain that represent the ownership of assets- usually a digital asset such as an image file. They were extremely popular in 2021/22 and the record most expensive NFT was sold for $91.8mn. Research now suggests that 95% of NFTs are totally worthless now though, and that also 79% of all NFT collections have remained unsold.</p>
