					<h2><b>Why I chose to study aerospace engineering</b></h2>
				</header>
				<p>I initially wanted to become a pilot, but grew a love for physics and wanted to answer all of the questions that had built up in my mind. I not only wanted to understand, but I wanted to to design and shape the future. The aviation industry has a huge role to play in creating a greener future, and the engineers are the driving force behind change. This is a very exciting space that is brimming with much needed innovation, and we are seeing this with the push for hydrogen-powered aircraft.</p>

												<td>Space Systems</td>
												<td>The unit introduces spacecraft engineering from a system level perspective. First students learn about the context of space exploration through a history of space lecture. Then payloads as the drivers of mission design are examined. After this, orbital mechanics is covered up to Hohmann transfer level. Labs are used to reinforce understanding of orbital mechanics with a short piece of coursework using the orbit modelling software to assess understanding of calculations and terminology.

													Propulsion and launchers follow with calculations of delta V. Then spacecraft subsystems are covered next (including power, thermal, communications, mechanical systems, AOCS), with an emphasis on how these systems work together to deliver a specific mission. A blackboard quiz provides feedback to give students a chance to test themselves. The course finishes with two industrial satellite case studies, at least one of these is provided by industry. Example sheets, examples classes, videos and demonstrations support the learning throughout.</td>
