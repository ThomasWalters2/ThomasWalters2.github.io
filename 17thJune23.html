<p><em>Sector Performance (Finviz)</em></p>
<!-- <p><br></p> -->
<h4><b>UK CPI Release</b></h4>
<p>UK inflation fell to 7.9% from 8.7% in May (vs 8.2% expected), but is still of course way higher than the 2% target. Fuel prices fell a staggering 22.7%. This positive news comes after four consecutive surprises of higher-than-expected inflation statistics. The UK lags behind the US in tackling inflation and rate hikes, but this surprise has caused GBPUSD to fall 1.83% this week. 50bps hike from the BoE is now less likely and will have to be re-calculated in line with this new data.</p>
