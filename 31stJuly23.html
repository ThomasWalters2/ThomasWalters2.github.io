<h4><b>China CPI Release and Deflation</b></h4>
<p>China is now in a period of deflation after a CPI release of -0.3% in July. This has been driven by reduced exports, struggling real estate market and youth unemployment levels.<br> Consumer inflation is now at 0% and housing market sales have fallen dramatically (by 33.1% from last July).</p>

<h4><b>US Debt Rating Dowgrade</b></h4>
<p>Fitch has downgraded US debt from AAA to AA+ due to reasons including; political instability, interest payments and a drop in governance standards. Note that AAA is the safest possible debt rating, suggesting extremely low possibility of a default. Despite a downgrade, it is <em>very</em> unlikely that this default will happen. The U.S. Treasury market saw a sell off in repsonse, and the 2 year treasury yield sits at just below 5%.</p>

<h4><b>Positive Inflation Data for the US</b></h4>
<p>The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index) grew 3% for the year and 0.2% for the month, this is a key indicator that the FED rely on for rate decisions. This is the lowest rate of acceleration in 2 years and as you would imagine, equities responded well.  </p>

<h4><b>Oil Earnings: Chevron</b></h4>
<p>Sales came in at $48.8bn, with $9.2bn in cash and $6bn in profit. This may seem great, but their profit is roughly half that of a year ago. Suprisingly, their production actually grew, but this decline is due to a $33 reduction in the price of a barrel of oil, though since the prices have begin to rally. Chevron also purchased PDC Energy, and so their forecast is somewhat bright. </p>
