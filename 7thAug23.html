<p><em>Sector Performance</em></p>

<h4><b>US Inflation: July</b></h4>
<p>Due to a pullback in falling gas prices, inflation increased from 3% in June to 3.2% in July</p>

<h4><b>Is AI a bubble waiting to burst?</b></h4>
<p>AI is certainly a buzzword right now as companies are doing anything to use it. A Morgan Stanley Report however claimed AI stocks have already exceeded the typical gain of an industry that becomes the 'next best thing'. The US Large-cap tech sector has boomed over 200% this year alone. The action of investors trying to escape the bubble before its too late, could cause the burst. In fact, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque said: â€œI think this will be the biggest bubble of all time." There is a very interesting report from Goldman Sachs questioning if it is all just a 'hype', which can be found <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/top-of-mind/generative-ai-hype-or-truly-transformative/report.pdf">here</a>. Investment Forecast in AI is expected to reach $200bn globally by 2025.</p>

<h4><b>US Banks downgraded by Moodys</b></h4>
<p>10 Banks had their credit ratings lowered, and others were warned that their investment grade ratings are to be reviewed including Bank of New York Mellon. This is believed to be due to less confidence for customers and higher interest rates which impact smaller banks as deposits have fled to larger banks. Not good for small/medium sized businesses!</p>
	
<h4><b>The Swiftieconomy</b></h4>
<p>The Eras tour is expected to break (and smash) records for the most ever sales at $1.6bn. There was even 2.3 magnitude earthquake due to the atmosphere at her Seattle concert. The tour is expected to promote $5bn in consumer spending, and the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia has attributed the tour as the driver of their toursim industry, boosting the economy. Lets not get too carried away though, the 'swiftieconomy' makes up only 0.04% of the U.S. economy's $13 trillion six-month GDP</p>

<h4><b>Germany Update</b></h4>

<h4><b>Longer term U.S.Treasury yields</b></h4>
